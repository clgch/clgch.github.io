My work concerns the propagation of epistemic uncertainties of a mechanical structure into its seismic fragility curves using machine learning techniques and the development of active learning strategies for fragility curve estimation.\r\nContact\r\nYou can write me an e-mail at: clement “dot” gauchy “at” polytechnique “dot” edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
