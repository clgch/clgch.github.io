# Current Position

Since November 2019, I am a PhD student in Statistics at [CEA](http://www.cea.fr/english/Pages/cea/the-cea-a-key-player-in-technological-research.aspx) 
(French Atomic Energy Commission) and Applied Mathematics Laboratory, Ã‰cole Polytechnique, under the supervision of [Josselin Garnier](http://josselin-garnier.org), PhD director, and Cyril Feau (CEA, [EMSI](http://www-tamaris.cea.fr/index_en.php)). My work concerns the propagation of epistemic uncertainties of a mechanical structure into its seismic fragility curves using machine learning techniques and the development of active learning strategies for fragility curve estimation.
